        3D max. with no extra length or min. with both extra lengths
            3H extra length in Spades.  Also bid this with extra length
               in both majors, slammish since you do not want 3N to be passed
               If opener bids 3S he is promising EL in both majors and a 
               minimum and responder can sign off or make further slam tries.
            3S extra length in Hearts.  If opener bids 4!h, 4!s is RKCB
            3N extra length in both majors
            4m (if it makes sense) natural, slammish with 44 in m and RM
