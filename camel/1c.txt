* The 1!c opening

  1C---
    1red 4+ !h/!s, 6+ hcp, may have longer suit elsewhere. 1!h denies 4 Hearts
    1S   Hand too weak for responding 1!d/1!h/1N
    1N   7-11 HCP, no 4cM, no shortage
    #PASTE std_nomajor

** After 1C-1!d/!h

  1C-1!d/!h;
  1!h/!s no four card fit for partner's major
  1S (after 1C-1!d) 1RF - 5=3=(41) shape upto 19 HCP
    1N relay to find out more
        2C/D natural 10--13
        2H 14--16 (2N asks and all non game bids are forcing)
        2S 17--19 (2N asks and all non game bids are forcing)
    2m signoff but opener must keep bidding open with a fit in that suit
    2M signoff
    3N signoff
  1N balanced 15--17, no fit, implies 4/5 cards in other major
  2C 4 card raise, strength unknown but likely to be minimum hand unless
     opener would like partner to be declarer or if he wants to show a strong
     raise with side minor
    2D invitation.  Opener can signoff in 2M or make further tries etc.
    2M signoff
    any bid beyond 2M - natural slam try
    3M GF, no slam interest unless opener has surprise hand
  2D GF hand with at least 5!d.  Bidding is natural after this
  2RM game forcing raise of responder's major, not unhappy about being declarer
  2OM GF hand with 5+ Clubs.  Subsequent bidding is natural
  2N balanced GF raise
    #PASTE camlet_2N
  3m roughly 14-16 HCP, 6+ cards, good controls (5m is possible) + other M
  3RM 16-17 HCP balanced raise.
    3N is an offer to play
    newSuit asks partner to assume this is a splinter and evaluate accordingly
  3M+1 17--19 HCP four card raise 4441.
    Cheapest shortness ask.  Opener bids shortness (3N=H spl.)
    4M signoff

** After 1C-1!d/!h-1N

  General principles:
  - Transfers to 2M always promise undisclosed length except for "impossible
    transfer"
  - Camlet Stayman promises EL in at least one major OR slammish with 5m
  - 2S is a 3 way bid and a range enquiry (invite with no EL OR signoff in 3m)


  1C-1!d/!h;
  1N---
      #PASTE camlet_1N
      2!d/!h transfer to !h/!s. Transfer to own major implies 5.
             transfer to 2!h followed by 2!s is impossible transfer (see below)
             transfer to own major followed by 2N is natural invitational
             transfer followed by minor promises 5M+4m
      2S range enquiry (opener bids 2N/3!c with min./max).
         Resp. can pass or correct to 3!c or 3!d or 3!n
      2N invitational hand with 5M + 5m.
         Opener can bid 3!c/3!d as P/C, 3N/3M/4M
      3!c/!d 5-5, slammish
      3!h/3!s Sets suit as trump. On opener's forced relay shows shortness
              After ... 3!h-3!s, 3N shows Spade shortage and 4!h is balanced
              After ... 3!s-3!n, 4!s shows balanced hand
      4!c Gerber
      4!d/!h transfers to 4!h/!s

** Impossible transfer 1C-1!d/!h-1N-2!d-2!h-2!s

This is a mechanism for bidding when both hands are strong and balanced

We have assigned an artificial meaning to the "impossible" sequence
1C-1!d/!h-1N-2!d-2!h-2!s.  The reason I call this "impossible" is as
follows:

	- After 1!c-1!d-1N responder with 4+ Spades would transfer to S with 2!h
	- After 1!c-1!h responder denied 4 Hearts. Thus 2!d transfer to H is
      meaningless

We therefore use the above sequence to describe a balanced hand with a side 4 card minor and slammish intents.  

After this start

1C-1!d/!h;
1N-2D;
2H-2S;
3m 5 cards in bid suit (5422)
3OM 5 cards in opener's major.  
    With 5422 decide which feature to prioritize. Generally M is preferable
    since you can later give a choice of contracts
3RM maximum hand 4-3-3-3 shape.  Opener may sign off in 3NT 
3NT minimum hand 4-3-3-3 shape
2NT not a hand with 4-3-3-3 shape.  On this responder bids 3m naturally

Important note - With 4-4-3-2 hands facing a balanced hand, you pretty much 
need 33 HCP to make slam.  Make sure that you are assured of at least 32 
HCP between the two hands before you embark on these auctions …

*** Camlet Stayman with 5m+4M

Whenever Camlet Stayman bidder bids 3m at his next turn, he is promising a
GF and 5 cards in minor.  The general followup scheme is

- 3N feels good about bidding 3N
- 4m 4 card raise, no doubt about strain
- 3H expresses doubt about stopper in fourth suit
- Any other 3 level suit bid - at least three card raise


** After 1C-1!d/!h-1!h/!s

Opener has denied fit for other major and promised 4 cards in the other major.
This is forcing since opener could possibly (discretionary) still have some strong balanced hands

  1C-1!d/!h;
  1!h/!s
    1N signoff, upto bad 12 HCP
        2m natural, passable
        2RM 14 HCP, 3 card raise
        2OM some strong GF hand, meaning undefined for now
        2N 15-16, will probably have some 5 card minor
        3m minimum hand but very good suit
        3N to play (perhaps 22-23 HCP balanced)
    2m Forcing; 5 cards in original major + 4 cards in minor.  Does not promise extras
        2RM signoff, could be doubleton, not an exceptional hand
        2OM fit for minor, weak or game force (14-17 with shortness).  Forcing to 3m
        2N good 14 to bad 17 HCP with 5 cards in unbid minor
        3m fit for minor, hand good enough to accept a 3N invite
        3RM great hand with 3 card support for major, probably short in resp. minor
        3N probably 22-23 HCP balanced
    2RM-1 art. GF.  Opener bids naturally for now
    2RM signoff
    2S signoff
    2N invitational
    3m 6 cards, invitational values
    3!h/!s natural, invitational
    3N to play

** After 1C-1!d/!h-2!h/!s

This establishes a game force so the focus is now on exploring slam if it exists.  There is also a high likelihood that opener has first/second round controls in all suits since he could have chosen the alternative route of bidding 2C to make responder the declarer. 

  1C-1!d!h;
  2!h/!s--
    cheapest extra shape, usually 5 trumps (e.g. AKxxx, xx, xxxx, xx) with weak side suit or extras with some feature (e.g. side 5 card suit Qx,Axxx,JT9xxx,x
        3m natural
        jump splinter
    raise featureless 7-9 HCP or 12+ HCP.  On this 3M+1 is a serious slam try
    3m natural with two of top three honors or extra values.
    2N (after 2H) !s suit with two of top three honors or extra values
    3H (after 2S) !h suit with two of top three honors or extra values
    4M featureless 10--11 HCP
    JS various splinters - specifically
        3M + 1 - any splinter <= 9 HCP or 12+ and singleton in any of two suits
        below agreed suit (!c/!d if H agreed, !d/!h is Spades agreed).  Partner
        relays to find out shortness.  12+ hand makes one more try after signoff
        3M + 2 - non fourth suit splinter 10--11 HCP - then Astro like responses to relay
        3M + 3 - splinter in suit above agreed major, 12+ HCP
        3M + 4 - splinter in that suit, 10--11 HCP

** After 1C-1!s

A 1!s response is roughly a 5 HCP or lesser hand if it contains a major and a 6
HCP or lesser hand without one.


  1C-1!s;
  Pass    Opener has upto 19 HCP and 4/5 Spades. May have 4!h
  1N      Upto 19 HCP, balanced hand with 4/5 H

    3m    good hand with six cards
  2m 5 cards in minor + 4!h upto 18 HCP
    2N    good hand with 4H
    newSuit to play
    raise promises Hxx in partner's suit
    JS    big minor fit, promises ace in that suit

    2S default action with most hands
        2N bal. 22/23 with 4/5!h (see subsequent bidding below)
        3m natural, reversing strength hand with 4!s
        3!h/!s 4441 with short !c/!d
        3N 26-27 HCP balanced with 4/5 !h
    2N bust with some 6cm or both majors.
        3!c/!d P/C on which resp. passes/corrects to 3!d or 3!h (P/C)
        3N 26+ HCP bal. - responder bids naturally
    3m six cards with shortage in other minor and 4/5 HCP
    3M 4441 with shortage in C/D, upto 4 HCP
  2S 4!h + m, rev.+
    2N normal response, no 4!h
